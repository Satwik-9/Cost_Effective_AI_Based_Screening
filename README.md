# Cost Effective AI Based Screening

Introduction

This project implements a real-time mask detection system using image processing, deep learning, and OpenCV. It can be used to detect faces in a video stream and predict whether each person is wearing a mask or not.

Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy (np)
TensorFlow (tf)
scikit-learn (optional, for evaluation metrics)
matplotlib (optional, for plotting)
